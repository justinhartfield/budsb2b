    {
      q: "Will Buds confuse our customers?",
      a:
        "No. Buds appears as a clearly labeled 'bonus reward' option. Customers understand it's an additional benefit, not a replacement. Our UX is designed to complement, not compete."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we control which Buds rewards appear?",
      a:
        "Absolutely. You have three options: (1) Show only your own products as rewards, (2) Select specific partner brands like VIBES or Cookies, or (3) Use our algorithm to automatically show the highest-converting rewards for each customer. You can switch between these options anytime in your dashboard."
    },
    {
      q: "What if we want to stop using Buds?",
      a:
        "Simply uninstall the plugin. No contracts, no penalties, no data migration needed. Your existing program continues unchanged."
    },
    {
      q: "Do we need to donate inventory to use Buds?",
      a:
        "No. You can integrate Buds purely to offer partner rewards to your customers. Donating inventory gets you better placement, but it's optional."
    },
    {
      q: "How do customers redeem Buds rewards?",
      a:
        "At checkout, they see available Buds rewards alongside your existing options. One click adds it to their order. We handle fulfillment (co-pack or central)."
    },
    {
      q: "Will this cannibalize our existing reward redemptions?",
      a:
        "Data shows no cannibalization. Buds rewards are additiveâ€”customers redeem both. Think of it as expanding your reward catalog without expanding your costs."
    },
    {
      q: "Can we white-label Buds?",
      a:
        "Not currently, but Buds branding is minimal. The widget clearly shows it's a partner reward network, which customers appreciate as added value."
    },
    {
      q: "What platforms does this work with?",
      a:
        "Shopify, WooCommerce, and most major loyalty platforms (Smile.io, LoyaltyLion, Yotpo, etc.). We integrate via checkout widget, not direct platform integration."
