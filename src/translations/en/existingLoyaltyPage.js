      q: "How do I qualify to become a Buds Pro partner?",
      a:
        "Buds Pro is invite-only for premium cannabis retailers. You need: (1) Licensed cannabis retail operation in EU/legal market, (2) Existing loyalty program or willingness to implement one, (3) Commitment to offering premium rewards to network members. We verify all partners to maintain network quality."
    },
    {
      q: "Who are Buds Pro members and how do they find my store?",
      a:
        "Buds Pro members are the top 10% of cannabis spenders verified across WeedMaps, Weed.de, BlueDream.com, Weed.cz, and 40+ platforms. Average spend: â‚¬180+ per transaction. They use the Buds Pro app to find partner stores near them. When they visit, they identify themselves via app. You fulfill normally."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the average revenue impact for Buds Pro partners?",
      a:
        "Average partner adds â‚¬45K-â‚¬120K annual incremental revenue from Buds Pro members. Typical partner sees 15-30% total revenue increase. Buds Pro members spend 3-5x more per transaction than regular customers. This is pure incrementalâ€”they're NEW customers from the network."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to change my existing loyalty program?",
      a:
        "No. Your existing program stays exactly as is. Buds Pro runs alongside as a premium tier. Most partners use Parallel Modeâ€”Buds Pro members earn your points AND get network benefits. Zero disruption to current operations."
    },
    {
      q: "What do I need to offer to Buds Pro members?",
      a:
        "You offer premium rewards (exclusive products, early access, VIP experiences, or partner brand rewards). This qualifies you for the network. Buds Pro members expect premium treatmentâ€”they're high-spenders. Think of it as your VIP program, but the VIPs come from across Europe's top platforms."
    },
    {
      q: "How does Buds Pro prevent customer data sharing?",
      a:
        "Buds Pro is GDPR/DSGVO compliant. Members identify themselves via app at checkout. You see them as regular customers in your POS. We never access your customer database. No data sharing, no privacy concerns. Your customer relationships stay 100% yours."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I control which Buds Pro members shop at my store?",
      a:
        "All Buds Pro members are pre-verified high-spenders. You can set preferences (minimum spend, product categories, geographic radius) in your partner dashboard. Most partners accept all membersâ€”they're verified premium customers."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I want to leave the Buds Pro network?",
      a:
        "No contracts, no penalties. Simply disable the widget in your partner dashboard. Your existing loyalty program continues unchanged. Most partners stayâ€”the incremental revenue from premium customers is significant."
    },
    {
      q: "How is this different from WeedMaps or other platforms?",
      a:
        "WeedMaps is discoveryâ€”customers find you. Buds Pro is a CLOSED NETWORK of verified high-spenders. Think Amex Centurion for cannabis. Members are pre-qualified top 10% spenders. You're not competing for attentionâ€”you're accessing a curated audience of premium customers who already spend â‚¬180+ per transaction."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the cost to join Buds Pro?",
      a:
        "Zero membership fees, zero transaction fees, zero monthly costs. You 'pay' by offering premium rewards to network members (which drives their high-value purchases at your store). ROI is typically 8-15x. Average partner invests â‚¬5K in premium rewards, generates â‚¬45K+ in incremental revenue from Buds Pro members."
