    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Will this undercut our retail partners?",
        answer:
          "No. You control what products appear (samples, overstock, discontinued items only). Geo-restrictions prevent territory conflicts. Many brands require retailer consent before listing products."
      },
      {
        question: "How do we get consumer data?",
        answer:
          "Aggregated, GDPR-compliant analytics via manufacturer dashboard. See redemption patterns, demographics, and conversion rates. No individual consumer PII shared."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the minimum commitment?",
        answer:
          "None. Start with a small sampling campaign (100 units) or donate overstock as you have it. No contracts, no minimums, no monthly fees."
      },
      {
        question: "Can we target specific consumer segments?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Target by age, location, purchase history, or loyalty tier. Sampling campaigns can be hyper-targeted to your ideal customer profile."
      },
      {
        question: "How does fulfillment work?",
        answer:
          "Two options: (1) Co-pack - you ship directly to consumers when redeemed. (2) Central - send inventory to our EU 3PL, we handle all fulfillment."
      },
      {
        question: "What if products don't get redeemed?",
        answer:
          "Inventory rotates based on demand. Low-performing products can be withdrawn. For central fulfillment, we return unsold inventory after 90 days (your choice)."
      },
      {
        question: "Can we A/B test products?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Distribute variant A to one segment, variant B to another. Compare redemption rates and feedback to inform product decisions."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work with international manufacturers?",
        answer:
          "Yes, if you can fulfill to EU addresses. Many international brands successfully use Buds to reach European consumers."
